Compressing PDF files can significantly reduce their size, making them easier to share via email or upload to websites. Here's how to use our PDF compression tool effectively.

## Why Compress PDFs?

Large PDF files can be problematic:
- Slow to upload and download
- Use excessive storage space
- May exceed email attachment limits
- Take longer to load in browsers

## Using Our Compression Tool

1. **Upload your PDF**: Drag and drop or click to select your file
2. **Adjust settings**: Choose your preferred image quality and DPI
3. **Select color mode**: Choose between full color, grayscale, or monochrome
4. **Compress**: Click the compress button and wait for processing
5. **Download**: Get your optimized PDF file

## Tips for Best Results

- For documents with photos, use medium to high quality settings
- For text-only documents, lower quality settings work well
- Grayscale mode is great for black and white documents
- Experiment with different DPI settings to find the right balance

## Security

Your files are processed securely on our German servers and automatically deleted after compression. We never store your data permanently.
